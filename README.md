### Extract Meshes

When selecting the option to extract meshes from models, you'll have access to additional options:

| Option | Description |
| :----: | ----------- |
| `Meshes Name` | Decide on whether to use the name of the original mesh or the name of the MeshInstance3D node for the extracted meshes. |
| `Mirror Directory Structure` | If you have subfolders in your selection, the extraction paths will try to mirror the directory structure in the destination folder. |
| `Meshes Extract Path` | The path to the destination folder for the extracted meshes. |

> [!WARNING]
> The path to the destination folder is mandatory when this option is selected.
> 

### Extract Branch

This lets you import individual node branches as scenes.

With a node path selected, all of the first order children of that node will be exported as the root of there own scene file.
This is mostly useful if you have a 3D file with multiple models in it. e.g. An asset zoo style prop pack.

### Extract Materials

When selecting the option to extract materials from models, you just need to provide the path to the destination folder in `Materials Extract Path` field.

> [!WARNING]
> The path to the destination folder is mandatory when this option is selected.

### Replace Materials

When selecting the option to extract materials from models, you'll need to provide two informations per material:
- The material name in the meshes.
- The path to the replacing material Resource.

> [!TIP]
> Some asset packs may have models with similar materials with different names, you can add the same material path for multiple material names.

> [!WARNING]
> The material Resource path is mandatory for each material name entry.
